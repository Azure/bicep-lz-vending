## Overview

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è This module requires the usage of Bicep version `v0.11.1` or later. For details on installing/upgrading Bicep see: [Install Bicep tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/install) ‚ÑπÔ∏è
>
> ‚ÑπÔ∏è This module is also available on the Bicep Module Registry [here](https://github.com/Azure/bicep-registry-modules/tree/main/modules/lz/sub-vending). Examples also included in our [wiki examples](https://github.com/Azure/bicep-lz-vending/wiki/examples). ‚ÑπÔ∏è

The landing zone Bicep modules are designed to accelerate deployment of the individual landing zones (aka Subscriptions) within an Azure AD Tenant.

> See the different types of landing zones in the Azure Landing Zones documentation here: [What is an Azure landing zone? - Platform vs. application landing zones](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/#platform-vs-application-landing-zones)

The modules are designed to be instantiated many times, once for each desired landing zone.

This is currently split logically into the following capabilities:

- Subscription creation and management group placement
- Networking - deploy a Virtual Network with, optional:
  - Hub & spoke connectivity (peering to a hub Virtual Network)
  - Virtual WAN connectivity (peering to a Virtual Hub via a Virtual Hub Connection)
  - Link to existing DDoS Network Protection Plan
  - Specify Custom DNS Servers
- Role assignments
- Tags

> When creating Virtual Network peerings, be aware of the [limit of peerings per Virtual Network.](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits?toc=%2Fazure%2Fvirtual-network%2Ftoc.json#azure-resource-manager-virtual-networking-limits)

We would like feedback on what's missing in the module. Please raise an [issue](https://github.com/Azure/bicep-lz-vending/issues) if you have any suggestions.

## Parameters for module `main.bicep`

**Parameters documented here: [`main.bicep.parameters.md`](main.bicep.parameters.md).**

Details on each of the parameters, including examples and an [example parameter file](main.bicep.parameters.md#parameter-file) (this is not a valid parameter file as all parameters contain values, so you must remove the un-required parameters or set them back to their default value, as documented), for the [`main.bicep`](main.bicep) module can be found [here: `main.bicep.parameters.md`](main.bicep.parameters.md).

> These docs are automatically generated using [PSDocs.Azure](https://azure.github.io/PSDocs.Azure) from the Bicep module file itself and [this GitHub Action](.github/workflows/update-bicep-module-docs.yml) as part of PRs that amend this Bicep module.

## Consumer Guide

We have a [Consumer Guide](https://github.com/azure/bicep-lz-vending/wiki/consumerguide) available for guidance on how to consume this module.

## Example

> For more examples please see the [wiki](https://github.com/Azure/bicep-lz-vending/wiki) and if you cannot find an example you are looking for please [raise an issue](https://github.com/Azure/bicep-lz-vending/issues/new/choose) on the repo üëç

Below is an example showing how to use this module.

Most commonly this module will be deployed using [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/overview), with the [Azure Az Module](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/what-is-azure-powershell), with a supporting `.json` parameters file, one per landing zone to create/vend. Or the same approach but using the [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/what-is-azure-cli).

> **IMPORTANT:** The below example requires you have cloned/downloaded the entire repo and have it available at run-time on the machine running the below commands. It is also expected you are in the root of the cloned/extracted repository; otherwise paths will need to be changed in the below example.

### PowerShell Example

```powershell
$inputObject = @{
  DeploymentName        = 'lz-vend-{0}' -f (-join (Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMddTHHMMssffffZ')[0..63])
  ManagementGroupId     = 'xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx' # Set this to the Management Group ID you wish to target the deployment against. NOTE: This isn't the Management Group that the Subscription will be moved to, that is specified via the parameters.
  Location              = 'uksouth' # Set this to the Azure Region you wish the deployment to be targeted against. NOTE: This isn't the Region that the Subscription's resources will be deployed to, that is specified via the parameters.
  TemplateParameterFile = './landingZones/lz1.parameters.json' # This would be changed to the specific file per landing zone.
  TemplateFile          = "./main.bicep" # Set this to the path where you have checked out this repo to.
}

New-AzManagementGroupDeployment @inputObject
```

### Azure CLI Example

```bash
dateYMD=$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%S%NZ)
DEPLOYMENTNAME="lz-vend-${dateYMD}"
MANAGEMENTGROUPID="xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx" # Set this to the Management Group ID you wish to target the deployment against. NOTE: This isn't the Management Group that the Subscription will be moved to, that is specified via the parameters.
LOCATION="uksouth" # Set this to the Azure Region you wish the deployment to be targeted against. NOTE: This isn't the Region that the Subscription's resources will be deployed to, that is specified via the parameters.
TEMPLATEPARAMETERFILE="@/landingZones/lz1.parameters.json" # This would be changed to the specific file per landing zone.
TEMPLATEFILE="/main.bicep" # Set this to the path where you have checked out this repo to.

az deployment mg create --name ${DEPLOYMENTNAME:0:63} --parameters $TEMPLATEPARAMETERFILE --location $LOCATION --management-group-id $MANAGEMENTGROUPID --template-file $TEMPLATEFILE
