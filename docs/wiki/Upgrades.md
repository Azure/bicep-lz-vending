This module uses [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/s) versioning.

Given a version number `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, we increment the:

- `MAJOR` version when we make incompatible/breaking changes,
- `MINOR` version when we add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
- `PATCH` version when we make backwards compatible bug fixes.

## Upgrade process

If you are upgrading to a new `MINOR` or `PATCH` release, you will not see any breaking changes.

For a new `MAJOR` release, you will see breaking changes. We will publish guidance in the [release notes](https://github.com/Azure/bicep-lz-vending/releases) on GitHub.
